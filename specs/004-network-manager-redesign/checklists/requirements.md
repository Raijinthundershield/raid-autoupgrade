# Specification Quality Checklist: NetworkManager Service Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED (Iteration 1)

**Changes Made**:
1. Removed all implementation-specific method names, parameters, and code syntax from user stories
2. Replaced technology references (Rich, Console, dependency injection) with generic descriptions
3. Added specific metrics to all success criteria (100%, 5s/10s timeouts, 100ms for non-blocking)
4. Made success criteria technology-agnostic by removing library names and implementation details
5. Added Dependencies and Assumptions section with 4 dependencies and 5 assumptions

**Result**: All 17 checklist items now pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
