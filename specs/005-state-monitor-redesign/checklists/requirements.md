# Specification Quality Checklist: State Monitor Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT (state detection, failure counting, stop conditions) not HOW
- Written for developers and maintainers to understand feature value (testability, separation of concerns)
- All mandatory sections present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
- No framework-specific details (component names are conceptual entities, not classes)

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- All 14 functional requirements are testable with clear expected behaviors
- Success criteria specify measurable outcomes (90% coverage, 100% repeatability, zero functional changes)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format with concrete states and transitions
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions (invalid inputs, unknown states)
- Scope bounded to refactoring existing functionality (no new features)
- Assumptions documented (algorithm accuracy, integration points, test fixtures)

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- Three user stories cover complete workflow (detection → counting → stopping)
- Success criteria verify independent testability (SC-001, SC-002), behavior parity (SC-004), and maintainability (SC-006, SC-007)
- No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

✓ Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
✓ All quality criteria passed on first validation
✓ No clarifications needed - feature scope is well-defined as internal refactoring
