# Specification Quality Checklist: Service-Based Architecture Refactoring

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass validation. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Summary

**Content Quality**: PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT (service responsibilities, workflows, testability) and WHY (improve testability, maintainability, debuggability)
- No mention of specific Python syntax, frameworks, or implementation patterns
- Written for developers who need to understand the refactoring goals and success criteria

**Requirement Completeness**: PASS
- All 20 functional requirements are clear and testable
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "under 1 second", "under 200 lines", "90% coverage")
- Success criteria focus on outcomes (test execution time, code organization, backward compatibility) rather than implementation details
- 6 user stories with acceptance scenarios cover the key scenarios: testability, debugging, mocking, backward compatibility, phased rollout, thin CLI
- Edge cases identify 6 potential failure modes and boundary conditions
- Scope is bounded: refactor existing code without adding features, maintain backward compatibility, 9 sequential phases
- Assumptions (12 items) and constraints (10 items) are explicitly documented

**Feature Readiness**: PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and success criteria
- User scenarios are prioritized (P1: core testing, unchanged workflows, phased rollout; P2: debugging, mocking; P3: thin CLI)
- Measurable outcomes include performance metrics (1s test suite, 100ms initialization), code quality metrics (200 lines per service, 20 lines per CLI command), and behavioral metrics (zero breaking changes, 90% coverage)
- No implementation leakage (no mention of specific DI framework, no Python code patterns, no library choices)

The specification successfully defines the refactoring goals, success criteria, and boundaries without prescribing implementation details.
