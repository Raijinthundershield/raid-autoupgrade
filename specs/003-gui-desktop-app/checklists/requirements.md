## Validation Details

### Content Quality Assessment

**No implementation details**: PASS
- Specification describes WHAT the system does, not HOW
- References to existing system components (UpgradeOrchestrator, diskcache) are acceptable as they describe behavior, not implementation choices
- No programming languages, specific frameworks, or APIs mentioned in requirements

**Focused on user value**: PASS
- All user stories clearly articulate user goals and benefits
- Requirements map directly to user needs (workflows, feedback, error handling)
- Success criteria measure user outcomes, not technical metrics

**Written for non-technical stakeholders**: PASS
- Plain language used throughout
- Domain terms clearly defined (airplane mode trick, cached regions, upgrade workflows)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format accessible to non-developers

**All mandatory sections completed**: PASS
- User Scenarios & Testing: Complete with 7 prioritized stories
- Requirements: Complete with 59 functional requirements organized by category
- Success Criteria: Complete with 12 measurable outcomes

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

**No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: PASS
- Zero clarification markers in specification
- All requirements are concrete and specific

**Requirements are testable**: PASS
- Each functional requirement can be verified through manual testing
- Acceptance scenarios provide clear test cases
- Edge cases identify boundary conditions to test

**Requirements are unambiguous**: PASS
- All requirements use precise language (MUST, specific numbers, exact behavior)
- Error messages specified verbatim
- Timing constraints clearly defined (e.g., "0.25 seconds", "500ms delay")

**Success criteria are measurable**: PASS
- SC-001 to SC-012 all include specific metrics
- Time-based: "under 2 minutes", "within 5 seconds", "less than 500ms latency"
- Percentage-based: "90% of the time", "100% of the time"

**Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: PASS
- All success criteria describe user-visible outcomes
- SC-008 mentions UpgradeOrchestrator but in context of "no code duplication" (business outcome)
- No database, API, or framework specifics in success criteria

**All acceptance scenarios defined**: PASS
- 7 user stories with 3-4 acceptance scenarios each (28 total scenarios)
- Each scenario follows Given-When-Then format
- Scenarios cover happy path, error cases, and edge cases

**Edge cases identified**: PASS
- 9 edge cases documented covering:
  - Window resize during workflow
  - Missing network adapters
  - Failed automatic detection
  - Concurrent workflow attempts
  - Network failures
  - Application closure during workflow
  - Raid window closing mid-workflow
  - First-attempt upgrade success (known limitation)
  - Continue upgrade with low-level gear

**Scope is clearly bounded**: PASS
- Functional spec in plans/gui-functional.md explicitly lists "Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)" that are OUT of scope
- Clear distinction between P1 (critical), P2 (important), and P3 (nice-to-have) features
- Known limitations documented (e.g., first-attempt upgrade not handled)

**Dependencies and assumptions identified**: PASS
- Dependencies on existing CLI services clearly stated (UpgradeOrchestrator, diskcache, network management)
- Assumption: Windows-only (inherited from CLI)
- Assumption: Raid window must remain constant size during operation
- Assumption: Admin rights required when Raid launched via RSLHelper

### Feature Readiness Assessment

**All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: PASS
- 59 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios across 7 user stories
- Each requirement category (Count Workflow, Spend Workflow, etc.) has corresponding user stories

**User scenarios cover primary flows**: PASS
- P1 stories cover core workflows: Count (US1), Region Selection (US3)
- P2 stories cover workflow completion: Spend (US2), Network Management (US4)
- P3 stories cover supporting features: Logs (US5), Debug (US6), Status Display (US7)

**Feature meets measurable outcomes**: PASS
- Success criteria directly correspond to key user stories:
  - SC-001: Count workflow completion time
  - SC-002: Spend workflow completion time
  - SC-003: Region selection time
  - SC-004-012: Real-time feedback, persistence, error handling

**No implementation details leak**: PASS
- Requirements specify WHAT happens, not HOW
- References to existing components describe interfaces/contracts, not implementation
- UI behavior described in user-facing terms (buttons, fields, toast notifications)

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are concrete and testable
- Smoke testing approach confirmed (per user input) - no TDD required
- Commit messages should not include Claude signature (per user input)
- UI Layout Overview section added with single-page layout SVG diagram for visual clarity
