# The Airplane Mode Trick

The airplane mode trick is an exploit in Raid: Shadow Legends' gear upgrade system that reduces silver costs during enchantment events from ~15-20M to ~10M per gear piece.

## How It Works

The exploit uses the fact that upgrade attempts can be "spent" on lower-level gear instead of higher-level gear. By counting failed attempts offline, you can then spend those cheaper attempts on another piece before successfully upgrading your target piece.

## Requirements

- **Two 5-star or 6-star gear pieces** (both rare quality or higher):
  - **Piece A**: Level 12+ (your target piece to upgrade to 16)
  - **Piece B**: Level 10 or 11 (piece to absorb failed attempts)

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Count Failed Attempts (Offline)

1. Disable internet (turn off Wi-Fi and Ethernet, or enable airplane mode)
2. Navigate to **Piece A** upgrade screen
3. Turn off "Instant Upgrades"
4. Click upgrade and count each **red fail state**
5. Continue until the game freezes and shows a connection error message
6. Record the fail count as **F** (do NOT count the final successful upgrade)

**Result**: Piece A requires F+1 total attempts to upgrade (F fails + 1 success)

### 2. Spend Failed Attempts (Online)

1. Re-enable internet and wait for connection
2. Navigate to **Piece B** upgrade screen
3. Upgrade Piece B and count **all attempts** (both fails and successes)
4. **Stop immediately** after counting **F attempts**
5. **Important**: Do NOT continue upgrading Piece B after reaching level 12
   - If Piece B upgrades to 12 before reaching F attempts, find a new level 10-11 piece and continue counting from where you left off

### 3. Upgrade Target Piece

1. Navigate to **Piece A** upgrade screen
2. Click upgrade once - it should succeed on the first attempt
3. **Repeat steps 1-3** until Piece A reaches level 16

## Important Rules

- **Counter resets if**: You upgrade any item that is level 12 or higher
- **Counter does NOT reset if**: You use instant upgrade to reach level 10
- **Remember**: Turn instant upgrades OFF before counting attempts

## Unverified Tip

Some players report that accessories use a separate counter system, potentially allowing you to upgrade two pieces simultaneously (one gear, one accessory). This has not been verified.
